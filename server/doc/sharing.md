# Sharing


What types of sharing is supported.


- "private" private to your self
- "friends" not public, shared via giving opt in access to other users (maybe friends, or soon to be friends)
- "public" anyone, including search engines can find this


What kind of access can users have to my list?
- "read" - Allow them to read your list, this would be used with "friends".
- "write" - Allow them to update your list, and or delete your list, this would be used with "friends"


If you change from "public" or "friends" to "private", we will remove any existing access to others.


if "read" access = allow
elseif "public" share = allow
