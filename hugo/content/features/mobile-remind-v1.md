# But first, what is spaced repetition
People have concluded that being reminded of something over time helps remember it,

> taking it from your short term memory and moving it to your long term memory.

Honestly, [the overview on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is the best place to dive into the what.

Searching the internet for "spaced repetition" will show you research papers, blog posts and more that will help answer your questions.

At learnalist.net, with your help, we will remind you of something sooner or later based on time intervals.

We use the following time intervals

| Level | Over time |
| --- |---|
| 0 | 1 hr |
| 1 | 3 hr |
| 2 | 8 hr |
| 3 | 1 day |
| 4 | 3 days |
| 5 | 7 days |
| 6 | 14 days |
| 7 | 30 days |
| 8 | 60 days |
| 9 | 120 days |

### just remember
**You add an entry and we will handle the time intervals**.
