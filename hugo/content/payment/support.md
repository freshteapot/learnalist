# Why support?
-   You want to see the product develop.
-   Because you love hearing me tell you all about learnalist.
-   You are amazed that I still talk about this idea after a decade.
-   You want to buy me a beer but COVID denies us the simple pleasures in life.

# Features unlocked with support
- The ability to make public lists

# Take my money
**Payments are handled via stripe.com, not learnalist.net**
