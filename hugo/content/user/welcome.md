# Welcome
- Please excuse the mess and I am sorry if things dont work from time to time

# Today
- You can make private lists.
- You can make public lists.
- You can share your lists (however it will be a challenge to figure out how to share to a specific person).
- You can learn via [spaced repetition](/spaced-repetition.html).
- You can learn via total recall (TODO what is total recall)
- You can use [plank timer](/plank.html) to record planks (not really learning).

# Known issues
- The editor UI, in its atttempt to be helpful, sometimes leaves you in a state that can be annoying.
- If you do get into trouble
    - Open you dev tools.
    - Find where localstorage is and clear it.
    - Goto [the frontpage](/) and hopefully it will fix itself.
- A growing list of issues (feature requests and bugs) can be found [https://github.com/freshteapot/learnalist-api/issues](https://github.com/freshteapot/learnalist-api/issues).
