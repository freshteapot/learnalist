## What is dripfeed?
Over time it adds (feeds) items from a list into your <a class="link underline" href="/spaced-repetition.html#/overview">spaced repetition list</a> to help YOU continuously learn by not overwhelming you with you too many new items.

## How to use
- Find a list.
- Click on <button class="br3">ðŸ§  + ðŸ’ª</button>.
- Click on <button class="br3">DRIPFEED</button>.
- Done

## How does it work
Once you click on <button class="br3">DRIPFEED</button>.

- A snapshot of the list will be saved.
- When an entry from your <a class="link underline" href="/spaced-repetition.html#/overview">spaced repetition list</a> is viewed that is linked to dripfeed. It potentially triggers a new entry from the snapshot to be added for learning.

### More details
When you are recalling items in your <a class="link underline" href="/spaced-repetition.html#/overview">spaced repetition list</a>.

- A new item starts at level 0.
- When you click "later", learnalist will move the level up 1, ie 0 => 1.
- When the level is equal to 1, we will trigger a new entry to be added to your list.
- If you say "sooner" we will remove a level, if you go below 1, the next time you click "later" you will trigger a new item to be added as well. As you have triggered the level 1.
