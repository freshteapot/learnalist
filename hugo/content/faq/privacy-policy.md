Your privacy is critically important to us. At Learnalist, we have a few fundamental principles:

-   We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
-   We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

### What This Policy Covers
-   Our website (learnalist.net)
-   Our mobile applications
-   Our browser extensions

Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.”.

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### _Information You Provide to Us_

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:

-   **Basic account information:** When you login with google or AppleId, we store your userId.
-   **Personalised information:** You might provide us with information to personalise your experience with our Services.
-   **Content information:** Using our Services, you will store different content. For instance, a plank record; a phrase for spaced learning; a list of words
-   **Communications with us (hi there!):** When you communicate with us via form, email, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications.
-   **Location information:** Via our Services we might ask for your timezone. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.

#### _Information We Collect Automatically_

We also collect some information automatically:

*   **Log information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to a list on learnalist.net.
*   **Usage information:** We might collect information about your usage of our Services. We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.
*   **Stored information:** We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.

*   **Information from cookies & other technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Learnalist uses cookies and local storage to allow you to access your specific content.

#### _Information We Collect from Other Sources_

*   **Payment and contact information:** If you buy something from us our payment provider (stripe.com) will provide us with information about your purchase.


### How and Why We Use Information

#### _Purposes for Using Information_

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

*   **To provide our Services.** For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your content, backup and restore your content, provide customer service, and verify user information.
*   **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Learnalist and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
*   **To fix problems with our Services.** For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
*   **To customize the user experience.** For example, to personalize your experience.
*   **To communicate with you.** For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)

#### _Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information_

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience.

### Sharing Information

#### _How We Share Information_

*   **On mobile** we share a token with Google Firebase Clooud messaging to deliver you push notifications.
*   **Legal and regulatory requirements:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
*   **To protect rights, property, and others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Learnalist or the public at large.
*   **Aggregated or de-identified information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.
*   **Published support requests:** If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.

We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users' data. We aren't a data broker, we don't sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don't sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.

#### _Information Shared Publicly_

Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly. That means information like your public lists.

### How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it. For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to Learnalist website, like the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Learnalist and investigate issues if something goes wrong.

### Choices
*   **Close your account:** While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. Deleting your user is permanent and today requires you to email learnalist-privacy-policy@freshteapot.net to begin the process.

### Your Rights

If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.

#### _European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_

If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:

*   Request access to your personal data;
*   Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
*   Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
*   Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
*   Request portability of your personal data.

You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.

#### _California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)_

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:

*   Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
*   Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);
*   Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);
*   Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site);
*   Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
*   Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
*   Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).

If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:

*   Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came.
*   Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
*   Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.

#### **_The CCPA & Personalized Advertising in Our Ads Program_**

We do not show Personalized Advertising or Ads.
